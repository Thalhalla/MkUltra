# Rake

Ruby has a tool that was inspired by Make called Rake.  Martin Fowler has [blogpost](http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html) on this subject that I have always found very illuminating on the subject.

My philosophy on rake is thus, if you need the functionality of ruby in your Makefile then by all means call Rake from within a Makefile and get the job done.  Then come back to the Makefile where you don't have to wear out your {} keys ;)
