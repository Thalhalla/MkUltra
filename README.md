# MkUltra

This is a book dedicated to using Makefiles to make docker containers that have a persistent data volume mounted into them so you can go beyond trying out a container in a ephemeral way to something more permanent.  While, not exactly ready for heavy load production, as we are still dealing with singular entities and not clusters, I've found this method perfectly fine for my own internal projects.  Redmine is a great example.  

And we will certainly explore how to take it all further with Kubernetes as well.  But I will get you up and running a bunch of services as quickly as possible so you have lot's of toys to play with.
